# Better Reads 1.0
This was my original attempt at better reads.

This used server-side rendering and ejs tags to accomplish basic CRUD functionality.  I wanted to refactor this to be a more robust web app with:

- Users and individual profiles they could access.
- A more modern card format, instead of this scrolling "blog" format that felt very outdated.
- Animated flipbooks.

I thought React would be more well-suited for these needs, so I initially refactored this code to use for those purposes.
